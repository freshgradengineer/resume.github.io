## Instructions


To create publish a website on Github Pages, we will need the technologies mentioned in Prerequisites section above.

For speed, simplicity, portability, low cost of hardware and security, we will be implementing Andrew Etter's [Buy here] (https://www.amazon.ca/Modern-Technical-Writing-Introduction-Documentation-ebook/dp/B01A2QL9SS) recommended method from the book, which is to build a static website, which can be hoste on Amazon S3 or GitHub Pages.

## FAQ
 
1. Why is Markdown better than a word processor?
 
A. Since regular word processors have different functionality, options and various techniques for fine grain improvement of different elements of the page, it lacks speed. It is inconvenient to stop the flow of writing and manually move mouse to such options to apply a modification to text, such as making it a large element or heading. 

Main advantage markdown is that it offers consistency and is quick to modify individual words or sentences on the fly. 
 


2. Why is my resume not being updated on Github pages to display new deployment?

A. Sometimes the file that github uses is not updated for it to detect that there has been a change made. It can be solved for almost changing any file again and pushing the changes to github to see the new deployment shows up. More specific file that can be changed is index.html or _config.yml. Please see if any change within these files will make the github to display the newly rendered file.
