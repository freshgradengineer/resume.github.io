# README

## Publish Resume on Github Pages


## Purpose

The purpose of this readme is to descibe the necessary steps required to build a static website from scratch and publish/host it on Github Pages. The website will include a professional resume on display for prospective employers. 

## Jekyl Installation






## Prerequisites:

* Resume formatted in Markdown
* Jekyll [Installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) 



To publish a static website on Github Pages, we will need three technologies:

1. Jekyll
2. Markdown 
3. Git/Github



Include a link to a good Markdown tutorial under "More Resources." You do not need to explain how to use Markdown.
## Instructions

 including animated gif Use headings and numbered lists
Remember to use each step to explain both how to follow the tools and model Etter recommends and how to host a resume in GitHub Pages or Codeberg Pages. It's up to you whether you 1) begin with Etter's general process and then demonstrate the process with a practical step involving your resume, or 2) begin with the practical steps for hosting a resume and relate each practical step to a concept in Etter's book.
Add an animated gif: Include a demo using an animated gif in your README. The gif should feature your own resume (showing your own name).
More Resources - include:
1. a Markdown tutorial
2. a link to Etter's book
3. at least one other resource

## Authors and Acknowledgments
credit template authors and group members 6. FAQs - add (and answer) two FAQs, as described below:
1. A question about the overall process, such as "Why is Markdown better than a word processor?"
2. A question about the practical details, such as "Why is my resume not showing up?" You may use the example FAQs, or come up with your own.
